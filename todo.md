# TO DO
[ ] Edit Chapter 1

0. Introduction (6 pages)
[x] Fix handwritten feedback

1. Algebraic sets (12 pages)
[ ] Expand the Zariski topology section 

2. Affine varieties (10 pages)
2.3. 
[x] Make sure it is clear k is alg closed

3. Convex geometry (9 pages)

4. Affine toric varieties (8 pages)
[ ] Decide whether to mention 'normal variety' in intro/move to footnote.
4.1. Semigroups and semigroup algebras
4.2. Affine toric varieties
[ ] Define the torus T_N in an environment. Remove definition of T_N from faces and open affines section.
4.3. Points of U_sigma
[ ] Fix preamble in proof of Prop 5.3.1 (once it is explained how points in Spec(A) are hom A to k.)
[ ] Explain how to evaluate regular functions at semigroup homs (once it is explained how to evaluate regular functions at homomorphisms).
4.4. Faces and open affine subsets
4.5. The torus action
[ ] Make sure reference makes sense ("Recall that to evaluate the regular function ... we compute ")
4.6. Singularities

5. Affine GIT quotients as affine toric varieties (11 pages)

Aesthetic/etc. things to do later:
[ ] Make \emph usage is consistent
[x] Fix James Milne Reference (Lie algebras vs alg geo)
[ ] Fix reference list
[ ] Fix c.f. usage
[ ] Put examples in non-italics/make sure all environments look right. Remove all remark environments.
[ ] Make sure chapters have even length
[ ] Big plot of a singular example.
[ ] See if the 3D cone diagram in the convex cones section can be improved to make it clear it extends (i.e. add vectors pointing out).
