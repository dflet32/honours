# TO DO
[x] Edit Chapter 1 (5/10)

0. Introduction (6 pages)

1. Algebraic sets (12 pages)
[ ] Expand the Zariski topology section 

2. Affine varieties (10 pages)

3. Convex geometry (9 pages)

4. Affine toric varieties (8 pages)

5. Affine GIT quotients as affine toric varieties (11 pages)

Aesthetic/etc. things to do later:
[ ] Final read: consider \emph usage, whether references need to be added, c.f. usage, spelling/grammar and that all environments/spacing look good.

[ ] Make \emph usage is consistent
[ ] Fix reference list
[ ] Fix c.f. usage
[ ] Put examples in non-italics/make sure all environments look right. Remove all remark environments.
[ ] Make sure chapters have even length
[ ] Big plot of a singular example.
[ ] See if the 3D cone diagram in the convex cones section can be improved to make it clear it extends (i.e. add vectors pointing out).
