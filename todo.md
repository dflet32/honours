# TO DO
[ ] Write prerequisites section in GIT chapter
[ ] Edit Chapter 1


0. Introduction (4--5 pages)
[ ] Try to expand descarte/fermat section
[ ] Decide when to first mention "affine" varieties. Make a disclaimer about only affine varieties considered.

1. Algebraic sets (12 pages)
1.1.
1.2.
1.3. The Zariski topology
[ ] Expand this section 
1.4.
1.5.
1.6.
1.7.
1.8.
1.9.
1.10

2. Affine varieties (10--12 pages)
[ ] Fix proof that homs A to B are the same as morphisms Spec(B) to Spec(A)
[ ] Explain how points in Spec(A) are homs A to k (example in morphisms section). Explain how to evaluate regular functions at homomorphisms.
[ ] Add 29/09 Explicit description of morphisms of affine varieties section to document
[ ] Fix proof that the localisation homomorphism corresponds to the principal open subset X_f

3. Convex geometry (8 pages)

4. Affine toric varieties (8 pages)
[ ] Decide whether to mention 'normal variety' in intro/move to footnote.
4.1. Semigroups and semigroup algebras
4.2. Affine toric varieties
[ ] Define the torus T_N in an environment. Remove definition of T_N from faces and open affines section.
4.3. Points of U_sigma
[ ] Fix preamble in proof of Prop 5.3.1 (once it is explained how points in Spec(A) are hom A to k.)
[ ] Explain how to evaluate regular functions at semigroup homs (once it is explained how to evaluate regular functions at homomorphisms).
4.4. Faces and open affine subsets
4.5. The torus action
[ ] Make sure reference makes sense ("Recall that to evaluate the regular function ... we compute ")
4.6. Singularities

5. Affine GIT quotients as affine toric varieties (10 pages)
5.1. Algebraic groups and their actions
[ ] Write
[ ] Mention all reductive stuff
5.2. The affine GIT quotient
[ ] Consider which examples to add, and write these up
5.3. Invariants of a torus acting on a vector space
5.4. A^n//T as a toric variety
[ ] Make sure assumption is clear; in particular, that it doesn't change the quotient
5.5. Examples
[x] Finish writing these up

Aesthetic/etc. things to do later:
[ ] Put examples in non-italics
[ ] Fix table of contents
[ ] Acknowledgements
[ ] Fix \emph usage
[ ] Fix James Milne Reference (Lie algebras vs alg geo)
[ ] Big plot of a singular example.
[ ] See if the 3D cone diagram in the convex cones section can be improved to make it clear it extends (i.e. add vectors pointing out).
