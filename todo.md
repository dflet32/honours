%\begin{example}\label{coneanddualexample}
%Let $N = \ZZ^3$ and let $\sigma = \Span_{\RR_{\ge 0}}\{ e_1, e_2, e_1+e_3, e_2 + e_3\} \subseteq N_\RR \cong \RR^3$.
%Observe that 
%$$u_{\tau_1} = e_1^*, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, u_{\tau_2} = e_2^*, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, u_{\tau_3} = e_3^*, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, u_{\tau_4} = e_1^* + e_2^* - e_3^*$$
%are all nonnegative on $\sigma$ and hence lie in $\sigma^\vee$. 
%For each $u_{\tau_i}$, there is the corresponding facet $\tau_i = \sigma \cap u_{\tau_i}^\perp$.
%These are:
%\begin{align*}
%	&\tau_1 = \Span_{\RR_{\ge 0}}\{e_2, e_2+e_3\}, & &\tau_2 = \Span_{\RR_{\ge 0}} \{e_1, e_1+e_3\}, \\
%	&\tau_3 = \Span_{\RR_{\ge 0}}\{e_1, e_2\},  & &\tau_4 = \Span_{\RR_{\ge 0}} \{e_1+e_3, e_2+e_3\}.
%\end{align*}
%The other faces in $\sigma$ are the rays 
%\begin{align*}
%	&\tau_1 \cap \tau_3 = \Span_{\RR_{\ge 0}}\{e_2\}, & &\tau_1 \cap \tau_4 = \Span_{\RR_{\ge 0}} \{e_2+e_3\}, \\
%	&\tau_2 \cap \tau_3 = \Span_{\RR_{\ge 0}}\{e_1\}, & &\tau_2 \cap \tau_4 = \Span_{\RR_{\ge 0}} \{e_1+e_3\},
%\end{align*}
%and the origin $\bigcap_{i=1}^4 \tau_i = \{0\}.$
%The dual cone is generated by $\{u_{\tau_i}\}_{i=1}^4$, so
%$$\sigma^\vee = \Span_{\RR_{\ge 0}} \{e_1^*, e_2^*, e_3^*, e_1^* +e_2^* - e_3^*\}.$$
